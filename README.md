# Telemetry Monitoring System

A graphical user interface (GUI) application for monitoring telemetry data using TCP and UDP protocols. The application displays real-time temperature data on a graph and allows communication with a simulated server.

## Features

- Real-time graphical representation of temperature data.
- Send and receive data via TCP and UDP protocols.
- Simulated server responses for both protocols.
- Data visualization using Matplotlib.
- User-friendly interface with buttons and labels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- Optionally, you can use a virtual environment for dependency management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TelemetryMonitoringSystem.git
   cd TelemetryMonitoringSystem
   
## Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the application

python gui.py

# Usage

Click the "Enviar por TCP" button to send a simulated TCP message to the server and receive a response.
